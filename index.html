            <p>Black New Yorkers are a vulnerable population, often subject to more violence and racial discrimination than others in New York City.  </p>
 
            <p> Briana Monsanto, a 22-year-old New Yorker from Brooklyn, New York, remembers police racially profiling Black people in her neighborhood, Flatbush, Brooklyn. </p>
             
             <p>"I remember getting stopped by the police in Flatbush when I was 18 to check for truancy. Police were never stationed near my high school in Manhattan (predominantly white), but they lingered near Flatbush. It made me think of how my experience as a child could have been different with things like policing and metal detectors had I attended schools near my neighborhood," says Monsanto.</p> 
             
            <p>In 2020, Black New Yorkers made up 24 percent of NYC's population. However, 65 percent of murder victims and 74 percent of shooting victims were Black in 2020. </p>  
             
            <p>New York City News Service asked Black New Yorkers to reflect on their experience being Black in NYC. When Black New Yorkers were asked to choose words to describe their skin tone, their descriptions varied from mocha to different to gold. Black New Yorkers chose these words for many various reasons—their reasons can be seen when clicking on their image. </p>

            <p>Black New Yorkers are a vulnerable population, often subject to more violence and racial discrimination than others in New York City.  </p>
     
    <p> Briana Monsanto, a 22-year-old New Yorker from Brooklyn, New York, remembers police racially profiling Black people in her neighborhood, Flatbush, Brooklyn. </p>
     
     <p>"I remember getting stopped by the police in Flatbush when I was 18 to check for truancy. Police were never stationed near my high school in Manhattan (predominantly white), but they lingered near Flatbush. It made me think of how my experience as a child could have been different with things like policing and metal detectors had I attended schools near my neighborhood," says Monsanto.</p> 
     
    <p>In 2020, Black New Yorkers made up 24 percent of NYC's population. However, 65 percent of murder victims and 74 percent of shooting victims were Black in 2020. </p>  
     
    <p>New York City News Service asked Black New Yorkers to reflect on their experience being Black in NYC. When Black New Yorkers were asked to choose words to describe their skin tone, their descriptions varied from mocha to different to gold. Black New Yorkers chose these words for many various reasons—their reasons can be seen when clicking on their image. </p>
     
    <p>The skin tone of Black New Yorkers played a role in how they were treated in comparison to their other family members as they grew up. Jimmie McKinney, a 25-year-old student, experienced being "teased for [his] darker skin tone by [his] cousins & siblings growing up." Others like Aurélie Muntzel, a 27-year-old student, overheard comments about their skin tone when they were younger. "When I would go to Martinique every summer to visit my mom's family, people would always talk about the different "types" of black people. They had names for people who had loose curls and light eyes, dark skin and coiled eyes, tan skin and smooth hair, etc. They all had neutral connotations. It's sort of a remnant of slavery-keeping classifications of different mixes etc.," says Muntzel. Imani White, a 27-year-old student, found that having lighter skin helped her to avoid being made fun of. White says she is "pretty light," and she remembers "asking [her] mom about colorism and her experiences with it and [she's] not sure she could recall it ever touching her life as someone who is lighter-skinned. [She feels] the same. [She has] never been the butt of jokes or harsh comments. [Her] skin color has always been complemented — at least within my community," she says. </p>
     
    <p>However, Cheryl Anne Harper, a 45-year-old actress who also describes herself as light skin, remembers that having lighter skin played a negative role in the treatment of her and her family. "When I was a young adult, my skin was a lot lighter. People would remark that I was pretty because of it. Sometimes people would joke that "light-skinned" girls were stuck up. Sometimes people perceive me as delicate or weak. As I entered middle age, my skin became darker. In the last 10 years, there is hardly any mention of my skin tone or remarking about my appearance," she says. "I do think that when I was growing up, colorism was an issue, and definitely in my Dad, Elmer Randolph's generation. My father, who raised me by himself, was a lot lighter than me, and his eyes were green. I remember my Dad telling me that his mother repeatedly told him, "you better learn how to fight" because of how he looked. My Dad did have to prove himself repeatedly in his formative years because people in his neighborhood would try to intimidate him based on the assumption that his lighter skin tone and other aspects of his appearance were indicative of him having mixed blood, and hence resulted in him being weak."  </p>
     
    <p>Outside of their families, colorism played a role in Black New Yorkers' lives as they grew up. 
    McKinney says that colorism "was definitely present when [he] was younger with teasing and bullying. Dark skin wasn't something many black people, [he] knew, wanted to be." Avery Richardson, a 26-year-old New Yorker also experienced biased treatment because of his skin tone. "I get certain looks, and people tend to assume things about [me], especially when shopping, " he says because of his skin tone. Harper, whose skin is lighter than Avery and McKinney said when she was younger, people "perceived [her] as being less threatening when [she] was interviewing for jobs than some other people [she] knew who were a lot darker than [she] was. Sometimes people in school would try to bully [her] because they thought [she] wouldn't defend [herself] because [she] looked delicate." Like Harper, Muntzel found that her skin tone helped her blend in. Muntzel found that "in the USA [she] felt more colorism so to speak. [She] feels [she] was able to blend into a lot of groups. [She] feels like [she] has access to a lot more people. It's quite nice."  </p>
     
    <p>Being in NYC has also been essential in how Black New Yorkers think about their skin tone. Neil Silvera, 43, remembers growing up in NYC during the 90s and how he "was always treated better than [his] brother who is of darker complexion. The black community gravitated to me as a child because [he] was lighter skin tone, and aesthetically better looking." he says. In NYC, colorism "definitely played a role in dating and who was treated well socially in schools," says Richardson. Sebri, who grew up in Texas says that coming to New York City transformed her perspective on Black people. She "grew up in a predominantly white city, so coming to New York City and being able to see Black people of all shades was really transformative for [her], and it reinforced how beautiful we are across the board." Jermiena Piper, a 21-year-old who works in healthcare, agrees with Sebri, and sees  being Black in NYC as emancipating. "To be black in NYC is empowering because there are so many people just like me here, being a boss bitch." </p>
     
    <p>Every Black person has a unique perspective on how their skin tone plays in their life. The different experiences that Black people have had shaped how they embrace their Blackness and the city that shapes them everyday.
