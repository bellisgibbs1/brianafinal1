        <p>As a Black woman living in NYC, I have found it interesting to observe how people perceive my skin tone in different places in the city, from Jamaica, Queens, to Midtown Manhattan, to Crown Heights, Brooklyn to Harlem. Everywhere I went, I felt that I was being judged differently based on the way people looked at me as I walked by. Walking on the Upper East Side, where many wealthy white people lived, always made me feel uncomfortable or out of character. When walking in my neighborhood of Queens, Village, NY, where most people are Balck, I felt more comfortable being Black.</p>
    
        <p>Living through the death of many Black men and boys shaped this perception I had. The recent death of George Floyd caused me to think about how my twin brothers, who are two different shades of Brown, are perceived by people in New York City. My brother Spencer remembers a deli owner accusing him of stealing something in his deli, while my other brother Marshall whose skin tone is lighter, was not searched by the deli owner. How are other Black people in New York City treated based on their skin?</p>
        
        <p>I went around New York City and asked TK Black people their thoughts on being Black in NYC.</p>
        
        <p>I asked Black people in NYC to reflect on their skin tone by choosing one or two words that they would use to describe their skin tone. Words chosen ranged from the magical moon, different, to chocolate and beautiful healthy. People choose these words for many different reasons. Imani Sebri, a 25-year-old student, chose the word Brown because that is what her grandparents called her growing up. A 70-year-old teacher at Pratt, Jack Travis, chose the word deep Brown based on looking at Brown skin tones over the years. Ernest Brima, an 18-year-old student, describes their skin tone as different because it is different from most people in America.</p>
        
        <p>Many found that being in New York has helped them see their skin in a more positive light.</p>
        
        <p>Quotes from people about being black in NYC</p>
        
        <p>Every Black person has had a unique experience of being Black in NYC. These different experiences have shaped how we embrace our Blackness and the city that has helped shape us. New York City is one of the most diverse places in the world, and the diversity amongst Back people serves as a reminder that even the way we perceive our skin tones is not monolithic. </p>
